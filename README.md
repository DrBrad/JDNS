JDNS
=====
JDNS is a Java DNS library that allows you to host a DNS Server and make DNS Requests.

Why JDNS
-----
InetAddress is great because it will auto get the IP address from any hostname, however this isnt always a great option when it comes to security. This is because it will make requests to your DNS server posibbly bypassing SOCKS proxies.
This project will allow you to make requests to specific servers not what is defined by the host and potentially over SOCKS5.
